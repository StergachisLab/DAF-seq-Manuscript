# DAF-seq-Manuscript

Code used in data analysis as part of the DAF-seq manuscript: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.06.622310.

Data processing and analyses are organized in three main folders: “General” for DAF-seq preprocessing such as strand assignment, “Targeted” and “Single_cell”. Environments used in these analyses are provided in “envs”. Scripts associated together for a particular analysis are numbered in the order they are to be executed (ex. 01, 02, etc.). Raw data for each analysis can be downloaded from SRA by the user into the applicable folder (“data” for targeted and single-cell analyses).
